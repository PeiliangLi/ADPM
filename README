-------------------------------------------------------

------- Demo ------------------------------------------
To run the demo, simply run the following in MATLAB:

>> demo_pca_policy

The code assumes mex is setup in the system. If not,
the pre-compiled Linux 64-bit and MacOSX 64-bit mex 
binaries are provided under ./bin folder.
(Note: You can comment out 'pca_policy_compile;'
at line 21 in demo_pca_policy.m, if having trouble 
compiling the code on your Linux/Mac system.) 

The demo will show the top ADPM detection of person 
and car in the example images.

------- API -------------------------------------------
Standalone API for detecting a class of object is 
provided as the following function call:

>> ds = detect_object(image_file, object_class, display)

where the input/output arguments are

image_file:     image file path 
object_class:   object class name
display:        boolean flag of displaying top detection 
ds:             detecting bounding boxes with scores


------- Models ----------------------------------------
Original VOC DPM models and learned policies are
contained in ./models.

Currently, person and car models are provided. More
PASCAL VOC models will be available soon.

------- Source Code -----------------------------------
Our implementation is based on the publicly available 
original DPM and Cascade-DPM code.

Main source code is in ./src and ./mex folder. The 
main detection process is implemented in 
./mex/detect_pca_policy.cc

Files under ./external are a subset of publicly 
available DPM code, refer to ./external/README
for copyright.
