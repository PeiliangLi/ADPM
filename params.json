{"name":"ADPM","tagline":"Active Deformable Part Models","body":"## About\r\nActive Deformable Part Models is an active approach for part-based object detection, which optimizes the order of part filter evaluations and the time at which to stop and make a prediction. During inference, a learned policy is used as a look-up table to choose the part order and the stopping time based on the observed filter responses.\r\n\r\n![](http://cis.upenn.edu/~menglong/adpm/overview.png)\r\n\r\nIf you are using the code, please cite the followings:\r\n\r\n    Active Deformable Part Models Inference, Menglong Zhu,\r\n    Nikolay Atanasov, George Pappas and Kostas Daniilidis,\r\n    European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2014.\r\n\r\n    Active Deformable Part Models, Menglong Zhu, Nikolay Atanasov, \r\n    George Pappas and Kostas Daniilidis, arXiv:1404.0334 [cs.CV]\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\nTo run the demo, simply run the following in MATLAB:\r\n\r\n    >> demo_pca_policy\r\n\r\nThe code assumes mex is setup in the system. If not,\r\nthe pre-compiled Linux 64-bit and MacOSX 64-bit mex \r\nbinaries are already provided under ./bin folder.\r\n\r\nNote: You can comment out `pca_policy_compile;`\r\nat line 21 in `demo_pca_policy.m`, if having trouble \r\ncompiling the code on your Linux/Mac system.\r\n\r\nThe demo will show the top ADPM detection of person \r\nand car in the example images.\r\n\r\n## API\r\nStandalone API for detecting a class of object is \r\nprovided as the following function call:\r\n\r\n    >> ds = detect_object(image_file, object_class, display)\r\n\r\nwhere the input/output arguments are \r\n\r\n    image_file:     image file path \r\n    object_class:   object class name\r\n    display:        boolean flag of displaying top detection \r\n\r\n    ds:             detection bounding boxes with scores\r\n\r\n\r\n## Source Code\r\nOur implementation is based on the publicly available original DPM and Cascade-DPM code.\r\nMain detection code is in ./src and ./mex folder. The main detection process is implemented in \r\n\r\n    ./mex/detect_pca_policy.cc\r\n\r\nFiles under ./external are a subset of publicly available DPM code, refer to ./external/README for copyright.\r\n\r\n## Models\r\nOriginal VOC DPM models and learned policies are contained in ./models. Currently, person and car models are provided. More PASCAL VOC models will be available soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n## AUTHORIGHTS\r\nCopyright (C) 2013-2014 Menglong Zhu, Nikolay Atanasov,\r\n                        Samarth Brahmbhatt\r\n\r\nThis file is part of the Active Deformable Part Models code (http://cis.upenn.edu/~menglong/adpm.html)\r\nand is available under the terms of an MIT-like license provided in COPYING.
